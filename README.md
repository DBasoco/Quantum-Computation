# Quantum-Computation
As my future career goal is to work with quantum computers to create new networks and exploits, I wanted to display some basic understanding of the two current libraries. Having a root understanding of the physics and commands needed to run a QC is important in creating networks and algorithms for encryption in the future.

Some things that will be covered:
-Basic gates
-Ways to make a qubit
-RSA encryption and QFT 
-Shor's algorithm
